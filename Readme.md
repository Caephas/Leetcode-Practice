# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems.

## How It Works

1. I solve problems directly on LeetCode using the Leetcode extension.
2. Once solved, I push the code to this repository for reference and tracking progress.

## Goals

- Track my LeetCode problem-solving progress.
- Keep solutions organized for easy reference.
- Share my solutions with others who are preparing for interviews or learning coding.

## Contributions

Feel free to open an issue or pull request if you'd like to contribute or suggest optimizations for any solution.

Happy Coding! ðŸš€
